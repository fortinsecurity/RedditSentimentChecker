They'll hardly give us new IP roles, but they'll put us in any old frowsy remake to be the brunt of controversy for the pigs to eat.\n\nGits casting didn't feel out-of-place--hell, Major from the anime looks more like Johansen than actual Japanese. Growing up watching Gits, I never really saw Major as Japanese, but it would've been nice if they got an actual Asian/Japanese woman to play the role, though--considering I can't name a single Hollywood Asian actress that isn't Lucy or Sharon O. This wouldn't have been weird or a pity casting, it would've felt natural either way.\n\nMost of all I hate the fact that this was a slow work-week for me and I've spent too much time engaging with this bullshit issue.

You just choose whichever one you find more important.   \n\n\nIn my opinion: If casting a minority actor in an established character's role makes a lot of kids feel more included, the other downsides are negligible. It's a fictional character in a probably not so great remake, at worst we will have forgotten this movie in 10 years.  \n\n\nAnd about whitewashing: it's a cyborg character in a fictional body, in a movie that was purposefully directed at a Western market, like, who cares.

If you want to change it for some story or character reason, that's fine, but if you want to tell the exact same story but now they're black, what's the point? The same applies for a poc character that a white person plays.\n\nI think that the idea of representation is fulfilled more fully by creating actual poc characters instead of just saying \"now superman is black.\" It just doesn't make sense to change an established character. The spider-man thing is a good example of this.\n\nThey wanted a black Spider-Man for the ultimate universe, but they didn't just say \"look, it's black Peter Parker.\" They created Miles Morales, a character with his own story and motivation. And now there are people who enjoy Miles as much as or more than Peter.\n\nTo be clear, this only applies to characters. For example, I don't think it mattered at all that there were black elves in the lotr series. If they wanted there to be some Chinese people in Wakanda, go for it. If the main character is a title like Spider-Man, then any character can fill the role as long as they're a good character.\n\nUltimately, if they come out and say that every character I have ever liked will now be a person of color, it would not really matter too much, I just don't get it personally. It's possible that it's because I have never felt unrepresented that I feel this way, but it just seems like it would feel hollow to get your representation in this way."

        "One of the biggest themes in the movie is how your vessel is not who you are. She walks around unabashedly naked because her body is as important to her identity as a shirt. I think in stand alone complex she even mentions how it doesn't matter if her body was male or female shaped. I think GITS is uniquely suited for recasting. I was much more annoyed at how little faith the movie had at adapting the source material. I'm pretty sure in the movie she didn't choose to be a cyborg it was more of a deus ex / robot cop save you from death type of thing that undermines the majors agency and kinda removes a lot of the themes that actually would justify recasting"

It gets really annoying when every black main character has to have their race moment in TV and movies. I don't really want to be reminded of racism and how shitty we have it every time a black actor gets a starring role. \n\nIt would also be nice if I have a daughter if she can put on a Disney film and see a black woman as the beauty standard instead of the many iterations of Blue Eyes White Woman. \n\nReally I mainly want more black roles so I don't have to have to have the \"black is beautiful\" talk with my future daughter that I may never have."

        "At the end of the day no one should really care as long as the movie is good. GiaS was a pretty crappy movie except for the visuals and the art design. So was Last Airbender and many others that studios pushed out for a quick buck. Memoirs of a Geisha had a Chinese actress play a Japanese geisha, and that movie was great, so people (for the most part) looked past that. It is an actor\u2019s job to embody someone other than themselves - that\u2019s what acting is. I never get the outrage over this tbh."

But I didn\u2019t really complain too much at the time. \n\nAs for Ariel, I think it\u2019s weird that Disney recasts European folklore with POC instead of making new content with folklore from other places like Africa or India or Asia, etc.\n\nEither way the new trailer looks like shit. Horrible CGI, lighting, etc. so probably won\u2019t see it unless my wife wants to see it."

        "I was legitimately pissed off at it. Yes people who are fans and care about characters care about their representation in \"official\" media, why is this considered so cringe now? It's not like the new mermaid is a separate one, it's literally retelling a cartoon in live action.\n\nBy the way I was also pissed at the god awful lion king remake. Also I find how dreary and dim the trailer was to be way more unappealing than any casting choice. Like all these god awful live action disney remakes everything is dark as fuck to reduce cost. I hate this low effort garbage and I yearn for the day of the rat poison to finally put this horrible company down"

        "While i'm fine with Black Ariel, I was also mostly fine with white makoto up until a very specific point in the film. Granted I'm trying to remember as best  ican here but I'm pretty sure in lore she's majoitively artificial and was built to be perfect. So while, yeah it might be a bit weird to say to Scar Jo had the perfect looks. That was up until a point where they explicitly said \"no scar jo is just a japanese woman, nothing else, def japanese.\" That was weird."
