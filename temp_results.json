        "1. It's also the case that ETH/BTC did not reach the heights of the previous bull market\n2. Which is probably because of the merge hype, which will probably now die down again\n3. PoS made Ethereum clearly weaker. The whole premise of that security model is flawed in my opinion. As it turns out you don't have to put your own ETH at stake, you can just lure in massive amounts on your centralized platform by promising high interest rates or other perks and put their ETH at stake. You gona slash that?\n4. There is a lot going on in Bitcoin land, but it's all mainly happening in L2 and above and has no new coin attached, which makes it somehow completely invisible for this sub and hard to track.\n5. And no one can actually tell you if that will change again. With Bitcoin we know the exact numbers until eternity.\n6. Ethereum has somehow created a completely self contained financial system with lending and what not, all build around a thriving shitcoin casino. Looks like people like that. But it has not much usability outside that niche. Bitcoin on the other hand is targeting use-cases in the real world and sees some real adoption with it's Lightning network.\n7. So can Bitcoin, but it does that on it's layer 2 and it's not risking the integrity of the monetary base layer for random experiments. Meanwhile Vitalik has a whole roadmap that will take several years of rebuilding and changing the cogs around on their ruth goldberg machine, and the complexity is so insane that even the lead dev is already complaining about the unmaintainability of the code base.\n\nIt's in my opinion hard to tell what the future of Ethereum is. It's fate is still in the hand of a few central figures who make all the decisions, including changing the monetary policy around. And while it may have its use, I don't think it even remotely plays in the same league as Bitcoin.\n\nIn the end the most important property of a money isn't fancy tech and rapid development, it's simply TRUST. And the while VC nature of Ethereum and other VC driven crypto projects may draw in a lot of capital in the short term and maybe enough to flip Bitcoin for a while, but in the end it's all built on a shaky foundation that can't be trusted in the same way Bitcoin can.\n\nThat's why I will always put my money into Bitcoin and just a fraction of that into Ethereum, just for the case I'm wrong on all of what I just wrote.",

The risk reward there is a lot better than some other Alt coins.....however the risk still exists.\n\nYou seem to have a good outlook in holding it for the long term at 3+ years but add 2+ more years just in case. Honestly....set in your mind that you'll never be getting that money back. We're at an age where financial mishaps don't really have a large impact because we have time to make up for it (granted you are a healthy individual and expect to have an average lifespan).\n\nI'd never recommend putting all your eggs in one basket.

After a JRE he expects millions (maybe) of people to go, \"Wow!  I want some of that!\" and to try to get in on the ecosystem... so there's no point doing a JRE unless there's a system for them to get into.\n\nSo... therefore... if he's suggesting it, there must be something for them to get into.  After all, he could have just not suggested it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo here's what I think is coming.\n\nDjed is out in January.  World Mobile is about to put up its first aerostat.  Lace wallet is nearly ready.\n\nWith Lace you will be able to buy Djed stablecoins.  With these stable coins you'll be able to make loans to Africans ... who will apply for them on their World Mobile phones.\n\nWe westerners will be able to loan our stable-dollars out at around 10-15%... which is substantially more than you'd get in any US investment.  It's also substantially less than the 80% that the Africans normally pay for such a loan.\n\nYou'll also be able to buy WM Airnodes... the things that make the World Mobile network function... which will also bring the node owner 40% (or was it 60%) of the profits from the node.  This will make the mobile network spread faster and faster.\n\nThis will mean more and more people will have access to the loans... which means more and more people will think, \"Heck, I'll lend out $100 to an African.  Let's see what happens...\"\n\nAnd all of a sudden Cardano will fly to the moon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOr that's what I think anyway.
